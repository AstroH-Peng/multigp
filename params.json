It shows toy examples for a full covariance model and two\r\napproximations proposed in the paper <a\r\nhref=\"ftp://ftp.cs.man.ac.uk/pub/ai/neill/spmulti.pdf\">Sparse\r\nConvolved Gaussian Processes for Multi-ouput regression</a>\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Multi-output Gaussian process using a Gaussian kernel and a Gaussian covariance function\r\n\r\nThis example shows how it is possible to make multiple regression\r\nover four outputs using a Gaussian process constructed with the\r\nconvolution process approach. Note that there are some ranges of\r\nmissing data for outputs one and four.\r\n\r\n```octave\r\n>> demGpToy1\r\n```\r\n<center><img src=\"Toy_predictionFTC2.png\" width =\"50%\"><img src=\"Toy_predictionFTC5.png\" width =\"50%\"><br> <i>Left</i> First output in the four outputs of the demo. <i>Right</i> Fourth output for the same example. </center>\r\n\r\n### Multi-output Gaussian process using the PITC approximation and the FITC approximation (fixed inducing points)\r\n\r\nIn the <a href=\"ftp://ftp.cs.man.ac.uk/pub/ai/neill/spmulti.pdf\">paper</a>, two approximations that exploit conditional independencies in the model were proposed. Due to their similarities with the PITC and FITC approximations for the one output case, these multi-output approximations are named in a similar way.

The training data was sampled from\r\nthe full GP.  We generate 500 observation points for each output and\r\nuse 200 observation points (per output) for training the full and the\r\nsparse multiple output GP.  The figure 2 shows the training\r\nresult. The predictions shown correspond to the full GP, the DTC\r\napproximation, the FITC approximation and the PITC approximation. For\r\ndetails of the setup refer to the <a href=\"ftp://ftp.cs.man.ac.uk/pub/ai/neill/sparseMultigpRed.pdf\">paper</a>. The difference with the previous toy example is that for this case we optimize the position of the inducing inputs.  \r\n\r\nTo run the full GP, use\r\n\r\n```octave\r\n>> toy1DGgFTCExample\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run the DTC approximation, use\r\n\r\n```octave\r\n>> toy1DGgDTCExample.m\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n To run the FITC approximation, use\r\n\r\n\r\n```octave\r\n>> toy1DGgFITCExample.m\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run the PITC approximation, use\r\n\r\n```octave\r\n>> toy1DGgPITCExample.m\r\n```\r\n<center><img src=\"toy1DFTC4TrainTest.png\" width =\"50%\"><img src=\"toy1DDTC4TrainTest.png\" width =\"50%\"><br> <img src=\"toy1DFITC4TrainTest.png\" width =\"50%\"><img src=\"toy1DPITC4TrainTest.png\" width =\"50%\"><br><i>Up, Left</i> Output four using full GP. <i>Up, Right </i> Output four using the DTC approximation. <i><Down, Left</i> Output four using the FITC approximation. <i>Down, Right</i> Output four using the PITC approximation.  </center> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### School exam score prediction. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal is to predict the exam score obtained by a particular student\r\nbelonging to a particular school.  The data comes from the Inner\r\nLondon Education Authority (ILEA) (this dataset can be obtained <a href=\"http://www.cmm.bristol.ac.uk/learning-training/multilevel-m-support/datasets.shtml\">here</a>).\r\n\r\nIt consists of examination records from 139 secondary schools in years 1985, 1986 and 1987. It is a random 50% sample with 15362 students. From the multiple output point of view, each school represents one output and the exam score of each student a particular instantiation of that output.  The results in terms of percentage of explained variance are shown in the figure.  \r\n\r\nTo obtain the DTC approximation result, run\r\n\r\n```octave\r\n>> schoolGgDTC\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo obtain the FITC approximation result, run \r\n\r\n```octave\r\n>> schoolGgFITC\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo obtain the PITC approximation result, run\r\n\r\n```\r\n>> schoolGgPITC.m\r\n```\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"figureSchool.png\" width =\"70%\"><br> Mean and\r\nstandard deviation of the percentage of explained variance for exam\r\nscore prediction results on the ILEA dataset.
